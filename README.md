# Modifications/adaptations
1. Changed default countdown minutes (self.mins = ) from 10 to 0.
2. Changed root window close buttons name from "Quit" to "Exit".
3. Changed root window title to "CDTimer".
4. Changed root window default opening size from top left corner to the screen's center (using xxmbabanexx's answer on a StackOverflow topic @ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14910858/how-to-specify-where-a-tkinter-window-opens);
5. Changed the exit message to a funny one.

# To do
1. Add an audio and/or visual user notification when the set time has occured.
2. Extend functionality with preset timers (30, 60, 90 minutes).
3. Change the root window's icon from the default Tk to an appropriate one.
4. Compile a PE file for users with no Python installed.
